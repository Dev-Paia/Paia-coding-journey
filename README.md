## Paia-coding-journey

A raw, unfiltered log of my journey becoming a developer — balancing code, college, and discipline. This space tracks my progress, mistakes, and growth as I build my skills, one commit at a time.

**Note:**
- This log begins in **May 2025**, during my second semester of college.
- I’ve been coding since **Grade 9**, starting with C and Java (around 2020–2021), though not seriously.
- Started this GitHub log to consistently track and share my growth going forward.
