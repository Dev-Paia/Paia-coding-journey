## Paia-coding-journey

A raw, unfiltered log of my journey becoming a developer — balancing code, college, and discipline. This space tracks my progress, mistakes, and growth as I build my skills, one commit at a time.

**Note:** Although I created this GitHub journey log in May 2025, I'm currently in my second semester (started in February 2025). This log begins from the point I decided to start documenting publicly, not from when I first started coding.


## May 2025 – Week 1 ##

- Created GitHub account and set up profile
- Started this journey log
- Created "Paia-coding-journey" repository
- Wrote initial README.md structure
- Planned weekly update schedule (every Sunday)
  
- Outlined personal roadmap: 

  - Code every day 
  - Build and share projects regularly
  - Balance learning, college, and fitness for consistency


## May 2025 – Week 2 ##

- Practiced PHP regular expressions for input validation  
- Practised user defined arrays and explored a few basic built-in array functions in JavaScript 
- Built a basic form using HTML/CSS, integrating it with PHP and MySQL for database storage and data retrieval
- Reviewed MySQL basics and ran simple queries


- Faced some confusion due to deprecated PHP and SQL code taught in college:

     - Planning to explore PHP login systems 
     - Will revisit SQL joins next week
